# rcheck config file
# This configuration file is used by the commandline utility rcheck
#   to determine the paths and sizes of Sentinal files.  An file that
#   does not have Sentinal: True, will be ignored by the rcheck command.
# This configuration file is also used by the rcheckd service to
#   determine which files to monitor and what actions, if any, to take.

# Note this is a standard yml file, indentions have meaning.  After making
#      changes to this file it is higly recommended that you use a yml
#      validator such as http://yamllint.com to see if your syntax is correct.
#      In addition, you should check the eventlog, or logfile after 
#      starting or restarting the rcheckd service to see if your changes
#      cause any errors.  The RCheck service must be restarted for changes
#      to become effective.

# Logfile can be set to a file path or "EventLog" 

#Logfile: c:\temp\rcheckdtest.log
Logfile: EventLog
